# 🏛️ Allocation and Tracking of Public Funds using Blockchain

A CivicTech initiative built using **Node.js**, **Neo4j**, and blockchain principles to promote **transparency**, **security**, and **accountability** in public fund allocation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Allocation and Tracking of Public Funds using Blockchain** is a decentralized platform designed to immutably record, visualize, and manage transactions related to government projects. Built with **Neo4j** (graph database) and **Node.js**, the platform ensures a tamper-proof ledger system that provides real-time insights into how public funds are utilized.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Only authorized users can access the system, ensuring data confidentiality.
- 📊 **Visual Project Allocation**: Allocate funds to various states (e.g., Maharashtra), and view allocation history with graphs and tables.
- 🔗 **Blockchain-based Ledger**: Tracks every transaction with block index, timestamp, nonce, and cryptographic hashes for complete traceability.
- 📁 **Project Details Management**: Add and manage project metadata including name, description, state, and ID proof.
- 📜 **Transaction History**:
  - View sender, receiver, amount, project name, transaction ID.
  - Filter by project name for specific insights.
- 🌐 **Graphical Interface**: Intuitive UI for navigating through projects, transactions, and blockchain data.
